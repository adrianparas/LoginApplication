# LoginApplication

This is a simple java maven application that utilizes login/registration for users, allowing them to 
enter their information such as their name, username, password, and email upon registering. 
They are then taken to their dashboard with a welcome message along with their name in red being
displayed. This involves the connection of JDBC on a MySQL users database, Servlets, and 
Java Server Pages (jsp) to create dynamic web content.
